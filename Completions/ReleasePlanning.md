Overview: Everyone has worked to some degree on the existing requirements. All have created some new issues, and linked existing issues. All have used the labeling feature, and assigned themselves to some requirements. Some appear to have randomly assigned themselves to requirements, and others have had a clear strategy to take care of a specific sub-area.

From your comments in your respective rplog.md I understand that at least some of you had a meeting in late December to discuss the release planning, and used the MoSCoW methodology to prioritise the requirements and assign them to milestones. The reason why I wanted you to do this on It's Learning is so that I can see evidence of it, and the amount of contribution each of you put in. As it stands, I don't know which of you participated in the meeting, how much each of you contributed to the end result, or even if you actually /had/ a meeting at all. I am therefore going to disregard the meeting and only look at the evidence of the meeting in terms of what each of you present in your rplog file. There, I am going to look for a description of the methodology you used, and the results thereof.

On the use of MoSCoW: Your choice of method to prioritise the requirements is ok (even if left unmotivated). But so far (I've read 2/3 of your assignments) none of you describe how the results of prioritising the requirements were actually used as a means to assign the requirements to different releases. For example, I would expect all "must" and "should" requirements to be taken care of in the early milestones, leaving "could" requirements to later releases. Why you've scheduled to implement "won't" requirements in release 0.5 and 0.8, I don't understand.

Another issue that you have not considered in your release plan is the available resources. Some of you are assigned to plenty of issues in one release and almost none in the next -- how do you plan on keeping all of you equally occupied for the duration of the development project?

Reflections on RP assignment (rplog.md): F
Assignment Strategy: Random Assignment
Methodology for Release Planning: Not Presented


Todo in order to Pass:
- Decide on a methodology for conducting release planning and describe it (with relevant references) (1 page)
- List and discuss at least three pros and three cons with the selected release planning method (1 page)
- Apply it on the requirements in the LSRE-ReleasePlanningProject repository. Describe what you do, and why. (5 pages)
- Describe your experiences from using the selected release planning method, and your experiences from using GitHub's issue tracker for working with requirements and release planning (1 page)
