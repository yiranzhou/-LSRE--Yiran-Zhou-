Select /two/ articles that describe a method or technique for LSRE.
- Implement the two techniques.
- Keep a running log of your selection and implementation, with experiences therefrom.
- [-] Write a Report:
- [X] /Article Selection:/ Which articles have you chosen, and why?
- [ ] /Implementation Plan:/ How do you plan on implementing the proposed technique/method?
- [ ] /Execution:/ Describe what you have done.
- [ ] /Proof of Concept:/ Run through a worked example of using your implementation
- [ ] /Lessons Learned:/ What did you learn about LSRE/MDRE and the implementation?
- [ ] /Reflections:/ How does your implementation, and your experiences, relate to what other /research/ articles say?

Comments:
Article motivation: What defects are there, and /why/ do you think they are easy to use and implement? Empirical evidence?

RFC2119 tells you wether to use MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY to define how important a requirement are. Please adhere to this.
Seven Requirements? Anything is easy with so few requirements and you are not going to run into any relevant challenges at all.

There is no trail to properly see how you applied the two techniques -- I only see the results.

Where in your execution did you learn the lessons you state under "lessons learned". There is no connection to what you did and what you learned.
Please discuss your lessons learned.

Todo in order to Pass:
- Describe the two methods better.
- Describe in detail how you apply them.
- Apply them on a larger base of requirements.
- Discuss the lessons learned in connection to what you have done.
- Reflect and relate your lessons to literature.
