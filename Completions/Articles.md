###Qeustions
####• What is large scale requirements engineering?

~1000  orders of magnitude requirements.The requirements Managing a complete set of interdependencies is practically unfeasible, but feasible among small bundles of requirements. [1] 

####• What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?

A key challenge in construction of these support tools is how to scale them to handle a large volume of information. Particularly crucial are the ways in which large numbers of requirements and their interrelationships are presented to users. [2]

####• What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?

According to the B.Renell, The order of magnitude of the number of requirements are 1000. The 100 order of magnitude is medium scale requirements and the 10000 order of magnitude is very large scale reuiqrements engineering. [1]

####• Read up on and summarise [Strategic] Release Planning

Release planning is a process applying various types of upstream decision-making that combine market considerations with implementation concerns.Release planning involves aspects such as selecting what features and requirements should be in a certain
release, when it should be released, and at what cost[3]

###Articles
####•The Art and Science of Software Release Planning

-A good release plan should provide maximum bussiness value, satisfy the most important stakerholders, be fesible with available resource and reflect dependencies among features.

-Resease planning is ad hoc and rarely based on sound models and methodologies.It is hard to select and scheule features.Planning and follow-up replanning leads many extra activities.Another problem is that the planning scope is often limited to just the next release.
Even though there are guidelines exist for release plan in princple, they don't tell us how to operate.

####•Introducing Support for Release Planning of Quality Requirements -An Industrial Evaluation of the QUPER Model

-QUPER model is developed for supporting release planning and roadmapping of quality requirements.This paper presents one case of QUPER tailoring, implementation, and most important evaluation, conducted at Sony Ericsson.

-The QUPER model was developed in three main steps: 1. Problem definition help understand different requirement decision scenarios; 2.Model definition based on first step and including a benefit view, a cost view, a roadmap view, and the concepts of benefit breakpoints and cost barriers; 3. Experts are ivolved in Model validation. And we can observe that quality is continuous and non-linear from these views.

-The authors tailored the QUPER model and define 4 steps as following 1. Define quality aspects. 2. Estimate your product’s current quality (for a given release) and the competing products’ quality (at present or envisioned). 3. For each quality aspect and for each relevant qualifier, estimate the breakpoints. 4. Estimate candidate targets and discuss and decide on actual targets for coming releases.
