1.Read up on the Boston Matrix
Boston Matrix is a marketing tool used for product portfolio analysis and management. It describes the impact of market share and market 
growth by four catogories:qusetion marks, stars, cash cows, dogs[Oxford learning lab]. As assumpotion, the product will experience four 
catogries as the sequence of question marks, stars, cash cows, dogs, so that the company can make money.
Fistly, qusetion marks phase presents the product may be highly profitable, but the market share is very small and risk is high. If the 
product is not good enough or the marketing is not done well, the product may directly go to dogs, which means this product failed. If we
have done something but the product still keep a low market share and growth(goes to cash cows and quickly goes to dogs), we should release
resource from this product early and start a new project.
Secondly, products in stars phase are in quick increased market share and high profitable. Because the market is still rapid growing, 
companies must continue to invest in order to keep pace with market growth, and repel competitors. It is possible that the products will
not go to the cash cows, because of lacking of money and decision mistikes(extend unaccepted requirement).
