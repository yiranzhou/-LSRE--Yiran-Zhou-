### Experience

I have discussed many topics with professor in seminars. The discussions give me a lot of inspiration on requirements. And I realized RAM is not specialize for continuous integration reuqiremnets. Even though, it is useful.

In this courses, I spend much time on reading papers. According to the recommendation of professor, I know a lot of requirement
engineering techniques. What's more, I learned a lot of knowledge about the mothods to do a research and write a paper.
