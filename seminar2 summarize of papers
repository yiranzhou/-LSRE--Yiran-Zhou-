Towards a Reference Framework for Software Product Management
1.The goal of this paper is to provide a structure for a body of knowledge for software product management, by
providing a reference framework based on an overview of state-ofthe-art literature, and industrial case studies.
2.reference framework provides a starting point for:
- Definition of key terms and the identification of open research questions;
- Education of product managers and competence building;
- Development of improved, integrated tool support;
3.Considering the work of  a software product management, artifact hierachy is inevitable. In different type of
works, the artifact hierarchys are also different.   
  Internal stakeholders:the company board; research & innovation; the consultants of the services department;
  development; support; sales & markting
  External stakeholders: the market; implementation partners, development partners, distribution partners;
  customers
4.An overview of state-of-the-art.
1)Portfolio management: Introducing new products by looking at market trends and the product development
strategy. It contains 4 process in reference framework: parnering & contracting, market trend identification,
product lifecycle, management and product line identification.And it receives input from the Company board,
Market and Partner companies.
2)Product roadmapping:planning and portraying the use of technological resouces and their relationships over a
period time. It contains theme identification and core assets identification. And it receives input from product
lines from portfolio managemnet.
3)Requirements management:gathering, identifying, revising and organizing incoming requirements from the various
skateholders. Requirements are organized per product and core asset from product mapping.
4)Release planning: starting with teh product requirement prioritization--selected requirement--relese definition-- 
send to the company board--launch preparation package--skakeholders.

An industrail Survey of Requirements Interdependencies in Software Product Release Planning
1.Finding an optimal selection of requirement for next release of a software system is difficult. The product
manager need to consider available resources, delivery time, requirements interdependencies, requirements
priority, system architecture, and dependencies to the code base.
2.Case1:small company; mature product
  Case2:medium company; mature product
  Case3:large telecommunications company; mature product
  Case4:research institute;RE process is implicit
  Case5:medium company; RE process is implicit
1)Data colleciton: only consider priority; 20 requirements; pairwise comparison
2)Type of inderdependencies:AND;REQUIRES;TEMPORAL;CUALUE;ICOST;OR

Market-Driven Requirement Engineeering for software products
1.software product offer to an open market with many customers,so market-driven development came into being. And
there are three quesetiones promoted in this paper about the chanllenges of requierements engineering in a
market-driven software development context.
1)How to design and manage a MDRE process?
2)How to design and manage a MDRE repository?
3)How to make profitable release planning?
2.Concepts and Context. 
1)MDRE covers the specific activities: release management and market analysis.
2)Classification of software products:Generic,Customized,Customer-Spesicfic; Pure Hardware, Embedded Systerm(HW
+SW), Pure Software. Additional aspect:Enterprise, consumer.
3)The level of complexity of the UI also affects the MDRE process. I think no matter how the level of the
complexity of products is, the UI should keep simple. Users are impatient.
4)MDRE focus on delivering the right product at the right time rather than fulfilling a requirement specification.
5)MDRE is a long series of releases and undergoing continuous evolution rather than maintenance.
6)Requirements in MDRE are elicitated according to the market analysis rather than interviwing with the known users.
7)Characteristics of a typical MDRE context(original text):
  a)The devlepo organization makes all decisions but also take all risks.
  b)There is a continuous flow of requirements throughout the product.
  c)The requirements volume is potentially very large and continuously growing.
  d)Amajority of the requiremnets are infomally described.
  e)The product is evoving continunously and delivered in multiple releases.
  f)Release planning focuses on time-to-market and return-on-investment.
