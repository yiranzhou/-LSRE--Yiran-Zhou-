PAPER 1 
A Cost–Value Approach for PrioritizingRequirements
-It's the ultimate goal that software meets stakeholders' needs and expectations.However, in real-world software development, there are
usually more requirements than you can implement given stakeholders’ time and resource constraints.
-A process for prioritizing software requirements must be simple and fast, and yield accurate and trustworthy results.
-Cost-Value approach prioritizes requirements according to their relative value and cost.
-This paper introduce how to calculate pairwise cpmparisons detailly, and present how to decide the relative intensity of value of
requirement in case study.
-In case study 1:
  1)identified 14 high-level requirements (services) that covered the main system functionality, the project members reviewed and agreed
  on them.
  2)rank-order the requirements on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 3, where 1 denotes highest priority.
  3)a group of experienced project members to represent customers’views and carefully instructed them on prioritizing requirements,
making pairwise comparisons, choosing the scale to be used, and deciding how many comparisons would be needed.
  4)first according to value and later, in a separate session, according to the estimated implementation cost.
  5)the participants work with the requirement pairs in any order they chose, allowing for retraction during the comparison process.
-In case study 2, the steps is similar.
Acually, I think this way to get the relative intensity value of requirement is not so practice in real world development. We need more
analysis of market and more disscusion of the 'value' of requirement. But the method to calculate of relative intensity of value is
useful.

PAPER 2
A Method for Early Requirements Triage and Selection Utilizing Product Strategies
1.Introduction
-It is critical for product management to select the requirements aligned with the overall business goals and discard others as early
as possible. Due to the emergence of markets for off-the-shelf or packaged software, The result is a large amount and continuous flow
of requirements that threaten to overload the development organization.
-This paper explores how the strategic and technical perspectives can be combined to formulate product strategies that are good-enough
for early requirements triage and selection.
-The activities: According to the literature study an initial draft of MERTS was created and elicited information from industry .
following this. The input from the previous literature study and industry interviews was subsequently used for the creation of a final
version of MERTS. Initial industry validation is presented and a discussion of lessons learned highlighting initial feedback is
presented.
2.Related Areas and Literature Study
-Requirements Triage: a concept that can prioritize requirements. The author mentioned some criterias but did not give a exact 
definition in this section.
-Product Strategies:a)“where do we want to go”-finding out the right balance between the long term opportunities or goals and short term objectives. Goals are profit, growth, and market share.
                    b)“how will we get there”-The choice of customer targets depends on the nature of the goals and objectives selected when answering “where
an organization wants to go”.
                    c)“what to do”-For determining a product’s position in the market it has to be differentiated based on either cost
price or value of product offering. This means that the product has to be either low priced backed by low costs or better than
competitors’products as seen by customer.
                    d) “why would we be successful”.A solid product strategy needs to provide concrete arguments for the reason of its success in the light of customers’ preferences and competitive targets.
                    e)“when will we get there”.A roadmap is a relatively common way of representing targets based on development in
the context of time and releases
3.Initial Input from Industry
-Two telecom companies.
-There was no formal method for formulating strategies, explicitly stating directions for the products.
-The interviewees recognized that the five questions proposed in literature could be considered good-enough.
-People within the same organization did not share the same vision about a product or the organization’s mission statement.
-The requirements selection process could take 1-2 months of analysis, but highly experienced people are pressed by time constraints.
4.MERTS
1) Early Requirements Triage
-MERTS is meant to assist in early requirements triage and selection.
-Step1.Specify. Answer the three strategic questions ((1)Where we want to go?, (2) How to get there?, (3) Whatwill be done?) for each product.
-Step2.Assign Weights. The answers from Step 1 are assigned weights. The answers of each question have a total weight of 100 (Table 1)
and the total weight of the three questions is 300.
-Step3.Compare Requirements. There is an instance that shows the weights of same requirement are different in different market.
2)Requirements Selection for Release
-Step1.Specify product-technology roadmap.
-Step2.Estimate resources. For instance, use COCOMO to estimate.
5.Industrial Validation of MERTS
Method implementation: 
-Because interviewees realized the need of requirements abstraction for early triage and selection, the prerequisite need not to be considered.
-Technical product managers assign the weights,The method would offer decision support and structure, as well as clarifying business goals, objectives, and enable requirements triage.
-Select requirements also need to discuss with stakeholders.
-Once the weight are assigned, the time to select requirement will decrese.
6.Conclusion
-Well established concepts is useful to formulate requirement. At the same time, we also need experienced manager ands technical
experts to assign the weight of requirement. So I still don't think it is a structure or abstract approach.
