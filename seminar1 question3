What is roadmapping? How can you do it large scale?
Roadmapping: I think it should be the future blueprint of a project. In other word, we need keep updating  the requirements and release a new version of a product. In large scale, the complexity of updating will rise exponentially. So the most important thing is to plan a good roadmapping in the initial requirements.
The answer will keep updating as I read more papers.
